        <h2>FreeCodeCamp – A World of Knowledge</h2>
<p>First and foremost, we pay tribute to <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a>, the incredible open-source platform that empowers millions of people around the world to learn to code for free. Their step-by-step tutorials, supportive community, and hands-on projects have been instrumental in our founder’s development and the evolution of Simplify Problems.</p>

<p>Without FreeCodeCamp’s valuable resources and dedication to accessible education, our journey would have taken a different path. The platform not only teaches technical skills but also instills the importance of giving back to the community, something we strive to do through our services and projects.</p>
